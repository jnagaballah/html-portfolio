<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a mechanical engineering student with a passion for innovation, problem-solving, and creating systems that work beautifully—both in theory and in real life. 
  From my early academic journey to hands-on internships, I’ve always gravitated toward projects that blend technical challenge with real-world impact. 
  Whether it's designing automated systems, simulating dynamic models, or analyzing control mechanisms, I’m driven by the satisfaction of turning complex problems into elegant solutions.</p>

<p>In addition to my work in engineering, I’ve recently ventured into the world of web development to expand my creative and technical skill set. 
  Front-end development has given me a new outlet to express ideas visually and interactively, while sharpening my understanding of user-centered design and digital problem-solving. 
  I'm actively learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React—building interfaces from scratch and discovering how intuitive design can elevate functionality.</p>

<p>Beyond the classroom, I’ve found myself immersed in leadership and teamwork—serving as Events Head in student-led organizations, collaborating on design projects, and contributing to interdisciplinary research. 
  I believe engineering isn’t just about machines and materials; it’s about people, communication, and the drive to build things that matter. 
  Looking ahead, I’m excited to keep learning, collaborating, and pushing boundaries—whether through smart mechanical systems or impactful digital tools.</p>
